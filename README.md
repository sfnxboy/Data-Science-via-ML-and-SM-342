# SFNX's Data Science via Machine Learning and Statistical Modeling 342

Amir ElTabakh's 342 Repository

Math 342W. 

This course includes an overview of the following
Philosophy of modeling and learning using data. Prediction via the ordinary linear model including orthogonal projections, sum of squares identity, $R^2$ and RMSE. Polynomial and interaction regressions. Prediction with machine learning including neural nets (the perceptron), support vector machines and the tree methods CART, bagged trees and Random Forests. Probability estimation using logistic regression, asymmetric cost classifiers and the ROC / DET performance curves. Underfitting vs. overfitting and the bias-variance decomposition / tradeoff. Model validation including out of sample techniques such as cross validation and bootstrap validation. Correlation vs. causation, causal models, lurking variables and interpretations of linear model coefficients. Extrapolation. The R language will be taught formally from the ground and up  as well as visualization using the ggplot library and manipulation using the dplyr and data.table libraries.

The Labs folder includes PDF and R markdown files for each of the labs.
